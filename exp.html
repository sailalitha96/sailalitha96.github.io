		       <p2>  I was in my 2nd year of Undergraduate and wanted to intern at a research lab. I wrote a mail to Dr.Palani and he gave me an oppurtunity.This was my first exposure to work culture.I was given a project to develop a Biomimetic fish using Shape memory alloys.I learnt 3D printing and Arduino coding to rapidly prototyped and developed experimentation setup.The work was over 2 internships and we presented at the ISSS conference at IISC Banglore.
